It forced us to move to Github Pages much quicker without any preparation. \r\n\r\n### JaCoP Guide\r\n\r\n[JaCoP Guide](http://osolpro.com/jacopguide/guideJaCoP.html)\r\n\r\n### JaCoP API\r\n\r\n[JaCoP API](http://osolpro.com/jacopapi/)\r\n\r\n### JaCoP Description\r\n\r\nJava Constraint Programming (JaCoP) solver\r\n\r\nJaCoP solver is Java-based open source solver developed and maintained mainly by two people\r\n- Krzysztof Kuchcinski, Dept. of Computer Science, Lund University, Sweden.\r\n- Radoslaw Szymanek - Crossing-Tech, Switzerland and Vistula University, Poland.\r\n\r\nMoreover a number of students have contributed to the solver by programming first versions of different global\r\nconstraints and set constraints. The solver is being used in academia for research and teaching as well as in\r\nindustry for commercial purposes. The most successful use of the solver is within Electronic Design Automation\r\ncommunity, since both main authors come from that community.\r\n\r\nJaCoP provides a significant number of constraints to facilitate modeling as well as modular design of search.\r\nThis allows to tailor search to characteristics of the problem being addressed. It has currently more than 90,000 lines\r\nof code, not including examples and testing code. The examples which are the preferred way to document the abilities of\r\nJaCoP have more than 20.000 lines of code. The core developers have been working on JaCoP for past 10 years during their\r\nfree time as a hobby activity. It has been refactored, transformed, and improved many times. Initial versions of JaCoP\r\nwere even 3 orders of magnitude slower than the current version. JaCoP implementation has been influenced heavily by\r\nmore than 20 research articles. Moreover, JaCoP was used as a tool to conduct experiments for CP publications.\r\nJaCoP supports finite domains of integers and sets of integers.\r\n\r\nThe major focus of JaCoP are its constraints. These constraints include rich set of primitive, logical, and\r\nconditional constraints as well as many global constraints. The most important global constraints are as follows.\r\n\r\n- diff2,\r\n- cumulative,\r\n- alldifferent,\r\n- gcc,\r\n- extensional support (with three different state-of-the-art approaches)and extensional conflict,\r\n- among,\r\n- element,\r\n- circuit,\r\n- knapsack,\r\n- regular,\r\n- netflow, and\r\n- geost.\r\n\r\nJaCoP solver contains also front-end for FlatZinc language that makes it possible to execute MiniZinc models. It allows\r\nus to perform extensive testing with the help of other solvers as we can compare results from different solvers.\r\n\r\nJaCoP is an ongoing activity. We are working on it in our free time. The most recent addition is Scala based DSL so\r\nit is easier to create your own constraint programs even in more intuitive manner.\r\n\r\nJaCoP is also available from maven repository. For details, please check INSTALL file.\r\n",
